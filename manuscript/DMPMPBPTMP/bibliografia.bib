abstract = {When several products are processed one at a time on a single machine, the conventional approach of computing the economic batch quantity for each product cannot apply. An example for six products is considered, where the total production capacity on regular time is inadequate, so that overtime has to be used at an extra cost. A simple method is described for solving this problem when each product is produced once during a production cycle, the objective being to minimize the total set-up and holding costs per day. Schedules which involve batch splitting can reduce these costs further, and a guideline is proposed for the construction of sub-cycles. The results compare favourably with lower bounds computed for the purpose.}

abstract = {Multiple jobs are processed simultaneously on a given batch processing machine in parallel batching. The resulting batch is called a p-batch. Batching can lead to reduced production costs, but depending how the jobs are grouped into a batch can lead to better or worse delivery times of products. Scheduling jobs on batch processing machines requires grouping decisions in addition to the conventional assignment and sequencing decisions. Parallel batching is important in such diverse areas such as semiconductor manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, shoe manufacturing, and healthcare. This paper surveys the literature on parallel batching and will focus primarily on deterministic scheduling. We provide a taxonomy of parallel batching problems, distinguishing the compatible case where all jobs can be used to form a batch from the incompatible families setting where only jobs from the same family can be used to form a batch. Makespan, flow time-, and due date-related measures are considered. We discuss scheduling approaches for single machines, parallel machines, and other environments such as flow shops and job shops. In addition to the discussion of archived and current papers, we discuss also recent trends in scheduling jobs on machines with parallel batch processing. Finally, we provide a discussion of future research directions for p-batch scheduling.}

In general, plant designs are solved without considering operation decisions, whereas the proposed approach considers production planning as well as scheduling decisions. The time horizon comprises several periods where deterministic variations in prices, product demand limits, costs, and the availability raw materials are considered. The plant operates using different production campaigns throughout each time period. The proposed model allows the optimal plant structure (unit sizes and its duplication in parallel at each stage) to be obtained, as well as the detailed production plan for every time period. Thus, the proposed method allows assessments of the trade-offs between the different decision levels involved by considering fluctuations throughout the time horizon.}

abstract = {This paper presents a heuristic rule-based genetic algorithm (GA) for large-size single-stage multi-product scheduling problems (SMSP) in batch plants with parallel units. SMSP have been widely studied by the researchers. Most of them used mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation to solve the problems. With the problem size increasing, the computational effort of MILP increases greatly. Therefore, it is very difficult for MILP to obtain acceptable solutions to large-size problems within reasonable time. To solve large-size problems, the preferred method in industry is the use of scheduling rules. However, due to the constraints in SMSP, the simple rule-based method may not guarantee the feasibility and quality of the solution. In this study, a random search based on heuristic rules was proposed first. Through exploring a set of random solutions, better feasible solutions can be achieved. To improve the quality of the random solutions, a genetic algorithm-based on heuristic rules has been proposed. The heuristic rules play a very important role in cutting down the solution space and reducing the search time. Through comparative study, the proposed method demonstrates promising performance in solving large-size SMSP.}

The machine can simultaneously process a group (batch) of jobs, each of them having different sizes and processing times. The processing time of a batch is the longest processing time of all jobs in the batch. We analyze the strength of the LP-relaxations of two mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulations: a straightforward formulation and an advanced formulation. We prove that while the LP-relaxation of the straightforward formulation can perform arbitrarily bad in providing an LP bound on the optimal makespan, the LP-relaxation of the advanced formulation have some merit in providing a relatively good bound of makespan. With a detailed analysis of the problem, we prove a number of properties of the optimal solution and derive their respective valid inequalities (VI). These VIs are exploited in a novel MILP formulation for the problem. Extensive computations reveal that, with the help of the VIs, the proposed MILP formulation can solve large instances of the problem.}

We analyze the properties of the networked batch processes with suggestion of a rule-based completion time algorithm for a given processing sequence and production paths. We have studied on finding the initial optimized scheduling with almost satisfying the considered objective function by genetic algorithm. The used objective function in this problem is the minimization of the earliness and tardiness penalty cost function. The constructed reactive rescheduling mechanism is activated when the process deviate from the initial schedule. The deviation of the process is caught out by the monitoring system. The rescheduler modifies the processing times for the remaining batches after the deviation to minimize the effect of the deviation.}

A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is established to minimize makespan. A lower bound is proposed to test the solution quality obtained from heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, we propose five constructive and polynomially bounded heuristic algorithms. To improve the solutions obtained by these constructive algorithms, we describe a job family constraint-guided artificial immune system (CGAIS) based algorithm. In the proposed CGAIS algorithm, only jobs in the same family can be executed by the secondary immune response. The longest batch processing time rule is used to form the batches. The effectiveness of the proposed constructive and the CGAIS algorithms is empirically tested on the randomly generated problem instances. These computational results show that the proposed CGAIS algorithm can obtain better near-optimal solutions than the existing algorithms.}

In this problem, products of a product type are produced in series of stages to fulfill the demand. Each stage consists of a work-in-process storage with inventory capacity and a production machine with a production rate. It incurs an inventory cost in the work-in-process storage of a stage, and also incurs a setup cost whenever a production batch is formed in the first stage. The problem is to determine the formation of each production batch in each period such that the total cost of setup and inventory is minimized. For the problem, we first provide a mixed-integer quadratic programming model and then propose some optimality properties. Based on the proposed properties, we design an optimal algorithm to solve the problem in polynomial time. Finally, we report the performances of the mixed-integer quadratic programming model and the optimal algorithm based on actual production data. The computational results confirm the reliability and validity of the optimal algorithm.}

abstract = {In most multiproduct batch plants, the short-term planning activity starts by considering the set of product orders to be filled during the scheduling period. Each order specifies the product and the amount to be manufactured as well as the promised due date and the release time. Several orders can be related to the same product, though featuring different quantities and due-dates. The initial task to be accomplished by the scheduler is the so-called batching process that transforms the product orders to fill into equivalent sets of batches to be scheduled and subsequently assigns a due date to each one. To execute the batching procedure for a particular product, the scheduler should not only account for the preferred unit sizes but also for all the orders related to such a product and their corresponding deadlines. Frequently, a batch is shared by several orders with the earliest one determining the batch due-date. In this paper, a new two-step systematic methodology for the scheduling of single-stage multiproduct batch plants is presented. In the first phase, the product batching process is accomplished to minimize the work-in-process inventory while meeting the orders’ due-dates. The set of batches so attained is then optimally scheduled to meet the product orders as close to their due dates as possible. New MILP continuous-time models for both the batching and the scheduling problems were developed. In addition, widely known heuristic rules can be easily embedded in the scheduling problem formulation to get a faster convergence to near-optimal schedules for ‘real-world’ industrial problems. Three example problems involving up to 29 production orders have been successfully solved in low computational time.}

It can also be used to improve a non-optimal production schedule before it is executed. The approach is based on a continuous-time problem representation that takes into account the schedule in progress, the updated information on the batches still to be processed, the present plant state and the time data. To limit the changes on the current schedule, rescheduling operations involving local reordering and unit reallocation of old batches as well as the insertion of new batches are just permitted. In contrast to previous contributions, multiple rescheduling operations can be performed at the same time. The MILP problem formulation is iteratively solved until no further improvement on the current schedule is obtained. Three large-size example problems were successfully solved with low computational cost.}

A t the expense of imposing the normality assumption for product demand uncertainty and the SPC production mode, the original two-stage stochastic optimization problem is transformed into a deterministic mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem without relying on implicit or explicit discretization of the uncertain variables. This is accomplished through the explicit solution of the inner problem and the analytical integration overall product demand realizations. This problem representation and solution strategy result in savings of orders of magnitude over existing methods in computational requirements.},

The scheduling problem is decomposed into two sub-problems of order assignment and order sequencing. Firstly, hierarchical scheduling strategy is presented for solving the former sub-problem, where the multi-stage multi-product batch process is divided into multiple sequentially connected single process stages, and then the production of orders are arranged in each single stage by using forward order assignment strategy and backward order assignment strategy respectively according to the feature of scheduling objective. Line-up competition algorithm (LCA) is presented to find out optimal order sequence and order assignment rule, which can minimize total flow time or maximize total weighted process time. Computational results show that the proposed approach can obtain better solutions than those of the literature for all scheduling problems with more than 10 orders. Moreover, with the problem size increasing, the solutions obtained by the proposed approach are improved remarkably. The proposed approach has the potential to solve large size MMSP.}
