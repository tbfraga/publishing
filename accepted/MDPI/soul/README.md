# soul

soul package for latex and plain

Version: 2023-06-14 v3.1

Provides hyphenable spacing out (letterspacing), underlining, striking out, etc., using the TEX hyphenation algorithm to find the proper hyphens automatically. The package also provides a mechanism that can be used to implement similar tasks, that have to treat text syllable by syllable. This is shown in two examples.

This version is a merge of the original soul package from Melchior Franz and the soulutf8 package from Heiko Oberdiek
and support also UTF8.
