abstract = {Abstract A new method is introduced for optimally designing multiproduct batch plants under the single-product campaign (SPC) production mode. Uncertain future product demands are described with normal probability distributions, and more than one processing unit of equal size are allowed per stage. A t the expense of imposing the normality assumption for product demand uncertainty and the SPC production mode, the original two-stage stochastic optimization problem is transformed into a deterministic mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem without relying on implicit or explicit discretization of the uncertain variables. This is accomplished through the explicit solution of the inner problem and the analytical integration overall product demand realizations. This problem representation and solution strategy result in savings of orders of magnitude over existing methods in computational requirements.},

The parallel units on a batch stage can be operated in-and/or out-of-phase while all units on a semicontinuous stage are operated in-phase. The optimal location and size of intermediate storage is determined. A numerical example from the literature is solved with DICOPT ++.}

abstract = {A novel rule-based model for multi-stage multi-product scheduling problem (MMSP) in batch plants with parallel units is proposed. The scheduling problem is decomposed into two sub-problems of order assignment and order sequencing. Firstly, hierarchical scheduling strategy is presented for solving the former sub-problem, where the multi-stage multi-product batch process is divided into multiple sequentially connected single process stages, and then the production of orders are arranged in each single stage by using forward order assignment strategy and backward order assignment strategy respectively according to the feature of scheduling objective. Line-up competition algorithm (LCA) is presented to find out optimal order sequence and order assignment rule, which can minimize total flow time or maximize total weighted process time. Computational results show that the proposed approach can obtain better solutions than those of the literature for all scheduling problems with more than 10 orders. Moreover, with the problem size increasing, the solutions obtained by the proposed approach are improved remarkably. The proposed approach has the potential to solve large size MMSP.}
