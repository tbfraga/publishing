abstract = {One of the application areas of genetic algorithms is parameter optimization. This paper addresses the problem of optimizing a set of parameters that represent the weights of criteria, where the sum of all weights is 1. A chromosome represents the values of the weights, possibly along with some cut-off points. A new crossover operation, called continuous uniform crossover, is proposed, such that it produces valid chromosomes given that the parent chromosomes are valid. The new crossover technique is applied to the problem of multicriteria inventory classification. The results are compared with the classical inventory classification technique using the Analytical Hierarchy Process.}

abstract = {The automobile industry frequently uses rubber in the body structure of its components. The rubber parts contribute around 20% of the entire body structure. Storing the inventory of the rubber components is the main problem in the automobile industry. A Multi Criteria Inventory Classification (MCIC) is one of the effective inventory classification techniques. In MCIC, various criteria and sub criteria are also considered for classification of the inventory. In this paper, the MCIC method has been proposed for the classification of the inventory of an automobile rubber components manufacturing industry. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been utilized for estimating the value of the inventory system. In the AHP, complex problems are categorized into various sub problems, which have been identified by using the hierarchical structure based on the criteria and attributes. Using the AHP, better inventory classification was identified for the automobile rubber components manufacturing industry. Further, this paper discusses the effective inventory control system of the automobile rubber components manufacturing industry.}

abstract = {The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has brought to light a series of concerns for the Brazilian population and government departments due to the different costly consequences that it has generated. It has also mobilized different strategic fronts that plan and implement several mitigating measures against the virus. Besides, the search for solutions for adequate care for individuals in need of support has been constant. This work uses ELECTRE-MOr, a Multi-Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA) method, to support the logistic plan for the vaccine distribution throughout Brazil, essentially to remote areas. The method allows an objective and structured classification of ideal types of thermal boxes for the storage of immunobiological inside the Cold Chain, presenting the best alternative that maintains the quality of materials until the final destination and has the best cost-benefit. Currently, the ELECTRE-MOr model is under development in a computational tool in Python, allowing the use of the method intuitively and clearly, enabling professionals of any area of expertise to apply it.}

abstract = {Product platforms are commonly used in industries with complex products and high competition like the car and truck industry to allow a customer to order a product that satisfy its unique needs. A consequence of product variety is that manufacturing and assembly processes need to deal with this variety as well. If the variety is low and changes of the product occur infrequently then the variety may be handled by designing the production system for a small set of typical products. But as the variety increases and changes become frequent the necessity for integrated product and production information model is high, to partially solve this problem Product Life Cycle Management (PLM) systems aim at providing an integrated model to all categories of users, e.g. product designers, product preparation engineers, line builders and shop-floor workers. All users need to access the information in the platform and refine and modify the information to reflect new knowledge that has been acquired. Today, most often multiple systems are used where some systems may store information in a structured way but often unstructured text documents are also used. This easily results in redundant information models and automated analysis is not feasible or not event possible because of issues regarding cohesion and traceability of information. The contribution in this paper is to discuss how a new type of tool for building domain specific languages and editors using language workbench approach can be used to support the different user categories in their tasks working with variability of a product and production system while at the same time provide cohesion and traceability of information.}

This paper proposes the use of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to reduce these multiple criteria to a univariate and consistent measure to consider multiple inventory management objectives.}

abstract = {Multi-Criteria Inventory Classification (MCIC) groups inventory items with respect to several criteria, in order to facilitate their management. This paper introduces a new hybrid method based on AHP and the K-means algorithm. On benchmarking data, it provides a clearly higher clustering validity index than previous sorting methods. However, as with previous methods, it is a full compensatory method. This means that an item scoring badly on one or more key criteria may still be placed in the best class because these bad scores are compensated. In order to prevent these hidden bad scores, a new variant method is introduced: AHP-K-Veto. The sorting is performed on each single criterion, where a veto system prevents an item evaluated as high/bad on at least one criterion to be top/bottom ranked in the global aggregation. This veto system is an assurance against hidden problems but slightly worsens the clustering validity index.}

abstract = {To optimize forest restoration initiatives, landscape planning emerges as a strategy. Thus, this work aims to determine the active restoration potential in Vale do Paraíba, a Brazilian region inserted in the Atlantic Forest biome, using multicriteria analysis and analyzing the result in light of socioeconomic and environmental contexts. Land use and land cover (LULC), hydrography, and slope variables were used in the multicriteria analysis, while average municipal income per capita, availability of restoration areas on rural lands, and water supply basins were used as socioeconomic and environmental variables. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Inference by the gamma operator were employed as multicriteria analysis methods. Two comparisons were performed with AHP, resulting in weights of 0.6 (LULC) and 0.2 (slope and hydrography) for AHP 1, and 0.5 (LULC) and 0.25 (slope and hydrography) for AHP 2. Values of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 were used in the gamma operator in Fuzzy Inference. Comparing results with restoration sites already implemented, AHP 2 was considered the best method. The restoration potential of each municipality was determined. Then, we grouped those with more areas for restoration, as an opportunity to develop common forest restoration programs. Ten water supply basins were identified with more than 40% of region extension with high restoration potential. Municipalities with a lower average per capita income and higher restoration potential were identified, highlighting a potential to generate income through restoration. The study concluded that Vale do Paraíba has a high potential for active restoration.}
